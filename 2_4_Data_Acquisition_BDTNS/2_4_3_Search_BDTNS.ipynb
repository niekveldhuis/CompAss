These notebooks produce two files (`bdtns_tokenized.p` and `ogsl_dict.p`) that are used by the present code.

    "Search for a sequence of sign values in any transliteration system recognized by [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl). Thus, sugal₇, sukkal, or luh, in upper or lower case will all return the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determinatives (semantic classifiers) may be entered between curly brackets or as regular signs. Thus, gesz taskarin, gesz-taskarin, {gesz}taskarin, and {ŋeš}tug₂ will all yield the same results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Signs may be connected with spaces or hyphens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Shin may be represented by š, c, or sz in upper or lower case; nasal g may be represented as j, ŋ, or ĝ.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sign index numbers may be represented by regular numbers or by index numbers (e₂ or e2, but not é).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compound signs (such as diri) are resolved in their component signs if the compound represents a simple sequence of signs. Thus diri is resolved as SI A, but gu₇ is resolved as |KA×GAR|.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To search for a compound sign by sign name, enter it between pipes (|) and use the [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) operators ., &, %, etc. The \"times\" sign may be represented by \\* (enter |UR₂×A| or |UR₂\\*A|, but not |URxA|).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wildcard: x or X, represents any number of signs in between (e.g. ku6-x-muszen will find all lines where HA is followed by HU with zero or more signs in between).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For large numbers of hits, the clickable links to [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) editions will make display very slow. Unclick the check box to display [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) numbers only, without links."
