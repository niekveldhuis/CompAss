    "The Treasure and Shoe archive from Drehem (ancient Puzriš-Dagan) is a relatively small archive (< 300 documents) of administrative texts that date to the 21st century BCE and deal with valuable objects (made of metals and valuable stones) and leather objects (shoes and belts, etc.). The archive was studied in detail by Paola Paoletti in her book *Der König und sein Kreis* (2012). The present notebook essentially takes the texts edited and studied by Paoletti, assigning roles to personal names in each text and creating edges between actors in the documents. By identifying nodes (people) and edges (connections between people) this notebook creates a social network that may be analyzed with the tools of Social Network Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present notebook will create the social network and do some initial plotting. The next notebook will focus on the analysis of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through several steps: \n",
    "* Data acquisition\n",
    "* Data cleaning\n",
    "* Defining Nodes\n",
    "* Assigning roles\n",
    "* Defining edges\n",
    "* Creating a Network (using networkx)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will pay much attention to checking the validity of the results. At every stage (identifying nodes, identifying edges, and creating the network) there will be the possibility to see the outcome for one single text with a link to the edition of that text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the treasure archive uses very standardized terminology (keywords), it is not always possible to determine nodes and edges programmatically. We therefore include the option to list the edges by hand in a Comma Separated Values file and add those to the edges that were found computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the keywords that determine the roles of actors in Treasury texts are also used in other Puzriš-Dagan files. The structure of the code is such that other archives may be analyzed essentially the same way."

Another leather text was identified among the photographs of texts from the Louvre ([AO 11393](http://oracc.org/epsd2/admin/ur3/P493329)) made available on [CDLI](http://cli.ucla.edu/P493329).\n",

    "### 1.3.3 Determine the Role of each PN\n",
    "The role of a personal name in an administrative texts is determined by keywords before of after the name. The keywords and their corresponding roles are defined in the dictionaries `key_post` and `key_pre` in the preceding cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame `PNs`, created above, is an extract from the DataFrame `words` and therefore uses the same indexes. If the index of a Personal Name in `PNs` is `i`, then the word before that name is `words.loc[i-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate over the index numbers in `PNs` to determine which keywords are found before or after. Before doing so we determine the extent of a document by finding the lowest and highest index number with the same `id_text` as the name instance we are dealing with. Similarly, we can define the extent of the line on which the name is found by finding the lowest and highest index number of the words within the document that share the same `id_line`. With these index numbers we can easily see whether a name is in first position in a line (its index equals the lowest index of that line) or what the last word is in the line in which the name instance appears. We can also check to make sure that when we inspect the next line, this line still belongs to the same document. Working with indexes this way is very fast and flexible - we do not have to look up the P number (in `id_text`) every time, or check the `id_line` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the structure of Sumerian grammar, keywords that come *after* the name may be separated from their name instance by one or more positions, as in:\n",
    "> \tARAD₂-{d}nanna sukkal maškim\t\t\tAradNanna the prime minister was representative. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice the keyword is always the last word on the line, or the first on the next line, as in:\n",
    "> \tlu₂-{d}nanna šagina nag-su{ki}-ke₄ \t\tLuNanna the military leader of Nagsu\n",
    "> \tšu ba-ti \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treceived\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if the PN is the first word on the line, we can check  to see if the last word on the line is a keyword and, if so, assign a role to the PN. We can also look at the first word (or two words) of the next line, to see if there is a keyword in that position. Any word following the PN that is not a keyword is considered an attribute (a father's name, a profession, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the PN is not the first word on the line (its index number is higher than the lowest index number of that line), one possibility is that it is preceded by a keyword, as in:\n",
    "> \tki lu₂-dingir-ra-ta\t\t\t\t\tfrom Ludingira\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a preceding keyword, we use the `key_pre` dictionary to assign a role. But a PN later in the line may also be the name of a parent (PN1 dumu PN2) or some other relative, or, occasionally, the name of an employer, as in:\n",
    "> \tgiri₃ a-bu-du₁₀ lu₂ a-bu-ni-ka\t\tConveyor: Abuṭāb the man of Abuni\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Abuni, his name is not preceded by a keyword, but there is another PN earlier in the line. Abuni does not have a role in the document directly, but he is involved indirectly by his relation of authority to Abuṭāb. In such cases the role is defined as 'relation'. \n",
    "\n",
    "If none of these methods results in a role assignment, we fall back to default roles. Default roles are different for different document types. Transfer texts (keywords šu ba-ti) and Intake (mu.DU\\[delivery\\]N) may record deliveries by multiple people who are not specifically marked with a keyword. The default in those texts is \"source\". Expenditure texts (zi-ga or ba-zi) may record expenditures to various people, not marked specifically. Here the default is \"recipient\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The code takes care of a few special cases. If a name is preceded by u\\[and\\]CNJ the role of that name is the same as the role of the preceding name. The expression ki PN-še₃ (\"to the place of PN\") appears a few times in this archive, but is otherwise very rare in Ur III. It uses the same keyword ki\\[place\\]N as the very common expression ki PN-ta (\"from the place of PN\") but has the opposite meaning. Since the morphology (-ta vs. -še₃) is not available in the `lemma` column, we have to use the `form` column to check for such instances. The expression kin ak, which precedes the name of a craftsman (finished work of PN) may be found on the line preceding the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaks in the text and horizontal rulings have their own entries in the DataFrame `words`, with separate index numbers and a separate `id_line`. This means that while looking for keywords in a preceding or following line the code will never \"jump\" over such a break. If, for instance, a document has a name instance right before a break and the line right after the break has šu ba-ti, this will not result in the role \"recipient\" for the name instance because the break is the next line. It is possible that a name instance right before or right after a break does not receive a role because key words are missing - and is then assigned a default role. This is a possible source of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the code here might be used in the same way for other Ur III archives, but it is likely that there will be other keywords and other special cases that one would need to consider."

    "## 1.4 Create Edges\n",
    "In order to create edges we need to decide what the direction is of the movement. For instance, goods go from a 'source' to a 'conveyor' and from there to a 'recipient'. This example creates two edges: \n",
    "> source => conveyor </br>\n",
    "> conveyor => recipient\n",
    "\n",
    "Each edge is a separate row in a new dataframe, whith four columns: `source`, `target`, `id_text`, and `edgetype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create an edge we find a name, check its role, and then look for a name with an appropriate role further on in the text. In an Intake document, if we find an `conveyor` (keyword ŋiri₃) we want to find a matching `recipient` (šu ba-ti) - this will be the first PN with role `recipient` after our `conveyor`. If we find a `recipient` we want to find a matching `expender` later in the text. In an Intake document we will not find one, because the `recipient`is found at the end with the keywords šu ba-ti (that edge has already been made when the `source` or the `conveyor` was encountered earlier in the text). In Expenditure documents, however, a list of recipients comes first, each one potentially followed by a `repesentative` or `conveyor` with an `expender` at the end. By  searching only forwards we avoid making double edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we can take care of multiple transaction texts, where we may have multiple pairs of \"source\" and \"conveyor\" (or \"representative\") and one \"recipient\" at the end, or multiple \"recipients\" followed by one \"expender\".\n",

The \"relation\" (here: Abuni) is the Source, and the first name encountered before this one is the Target (here Abuṭāb), whatever its role. Since, in this case, Abuṭāb has the role \"conveyor\" he will have three edges ([Trouvaille 86](http://oracc.org/epsd2/admin/ur3/P134759)):\n",

When displaying these sub-networks, one may open the edition or editions of the document(s) involved in [ORACC](http://oracc.org) by clicking on a button.\n",

There are two such dropdown menus, one where the user may select a P number (the text ID) and one with publication numbers. Publication numbers and ID numbers may be mapped to one another by two dictionaries (`p2pub` and `pub2p`) so that the two dropdowns change in unison.\n",

The third element of the tuple (the edge attributes) has the form of a dictionary. As a result, `s_edges` is a subset of the edges in G, that only contains the edges that are available in that one single document. Note that the edge attribute \"id_text\" is a string that may contain more than one P number (because the same source, target combination may be attested in multiple documents). That is why the consition is formed with an `in` expression (`if id_text in a['id_text']`).\n",

The radius defaults to 2, but may get any value between 1 (only direct neighbors) to 10. The P numbers of all the texts that contain this name in an edge are listed in the variable `textids` (a list) and this list is transformed to a single string and assigned to the key \"id_text\" in the dictionary `p_nos`. This dictionary is used in the function `open_edition_page()` to open one or more texts in [ORACC](http://oracc.org). In the graph, nodes and edges are colored in the same way as in `display_single_text()`. The graph G is a directed graph, but the function `ego_graph()` needs the option `undirected = True`, otherwise only outgoing edges are included in the Ego network. This does not change the network itself into an undirected network.\n",

The key is initialized with the value \"None\" (a string). When the functions `display_ego()` or `display_single_text()` are called the key will receive a value that either consists of a single P number, or a sequence of P numbers, separated by commas. This value is used in the URL that is the sole argument of `webbrowser.open()`."
